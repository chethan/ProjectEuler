Project Euler : http://projecteuler.net/

Project Euler is a series of challenging mathematical/computer programming problems that will require more than just mathematical insights to solve.

I am trying my hand on solving some of them . I have added solutions to different problems in Haskell , Ruby and C#.

Any feedback on the solution is welcome!!!!!
